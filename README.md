Vladimir Nabokov was a Russian novelist born into a vastly wealthy family and who had a first-class education under the instructions of a multitude of tutors. As he claims in his famous autobiography ["Speak, memory"](https://www.amazon.com/Speak-Memory-Autobiography-Revisited-International-ebook/dp/B004KABDWA), he learns to read in English before learning to read in Russian and was common to him hear stories narrated in English by his mother before going to bed. In a family that spoke Russian, English, and French in their daily life, Nabokov was - not surprisingly - already trilingual by the age of 12. 

Unfortunately, not all children in the world can have access to an education like that enjoyed by Vladimir Nabokov. However, with modern computers, we can build tools that can effectively democratize access to learn. This program is a project that I have been developing to help Brazilian children to learn how to read. In fact, in this first version, my goal is much more humble and very narrowly defined: I want to develop a tool to help my niece to learn how to read. However, the overall principles and the code produced within this project might be useful for someone interested in the development of a similar tool or in going ahead by improving this one.

Besides this README file, this repository contains a TASKS file that summarizes the project's goals and lays down the tasks whose completion is necessary to create the program.
